# Programmable Bitcoin

Muneeb Ali, CEO of Blockstack:

## Bitcoin -- The Secure Base

Categorize cryptocurrency into two schools of thought:
- bitcoin design
- ethereum design

bitcoin is:
- simple base layer
- limited scripting language (by design)
- "Digital Gold" usecase

ethereum is:
- complex base layer
- turing-completed language (solidity)
- "World Computer" use case

### Attack Vector

Bitcoin:
- low attack vector
- expressivity is low

ethereum:
- high attack vector
- expressivity is high as well

## Stacks 2.0
## Clarity Language
