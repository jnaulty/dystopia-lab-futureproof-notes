### Thanks

There were many people who made this event so great. Going to conferences and socializing with like-minded individuals on topics that are kind of 'fringe' and on the edge of human understanding is something I find incredibly human and very beautiful.

I am thankful for the people at Dystopia Labs and Blockstack for organizing this event. With all the chaos and disturbances in the world, it was refreshing to be able to sit down two days in a row and have talk-after-talk delievered with a strong sense of punctuality.
